Simple script to encode a word in a text using zero-width characters and decode it.

Idea was taken from this [article](https://medium.com/@umpox/be-careful-what-you-copy-invisibly-inserting-usernames-into-text-with-zero-width-characters-18b4e6f17b66.).

Usage:
Example encoder use: python encoder.py sample.txt encoded_text.txt examplestring
Example decoder use: python decoder.py encoded_text.txt
